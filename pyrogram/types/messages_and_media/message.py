                Animation to send.
                Pass a file_id as string to send an animation that exists on the Telegram servers,

            has_spoiler (``bool``, *optional*):
                Pass True if the animation needs to be covered with a spoiler animation.

            show_caption_above_media (``bool``, *optional*):

        Returns:
            On success, the sent :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` is returned.
            In case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned
            instead.

                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message
                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

        Other Parameters:
            current (``int``):
                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            *args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments as defined in the ``progress_args`` parameter.
                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            On success, the sent :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` is returned.
            In case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned
            instead.

                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.

            instead.

                The function must take *(current, total)* as positional arguments (look at Other Parameters below for a
                detailed description) and will be called back each time a new file chunk has been successfully
                transmitted.

            progress_args (``tuple``, *optional*):
                Extra custom arguments for the progress callback function.
                You can pass anything you need to be available in the progress callback scope; for example, a Message

                You can either keep ``*args`` or add every single extra argument in your function signature.

        Returns:
            On success, the sent :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` is returned.
            In case the upload is deliberately stopped with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.stop_transmission`, None is returned
            instead.

        Returns:
            On success, the sent :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Message` is returned.

            instead.

                text=message.reply_markup[i][j].text
            )

        Example:
            This method can be used in three different ways:

            1.  Pass one integer argument only (e.g.: ``.click(2)``, to click a button at index 2).
                Buttons are counted left to right, starting from the top.

            2.  Pass two integer arguments (e.g.: ``.click(1, 0)``, to click a button at position (1, 0)).
                The origin (0, 0) is top-left.

            3.  Pass one string argument only (e.g.: ``.click("Settings")``, to click a button by using its label).
                Only the first matching button will be pressed.

        Parameters:
            x (``int`` | ``str``):
                Used as integer index, integer abscissa (in pair with y) or as string label.
                Defaults to 0 (first button).

            y (``int``, *optional*):
                Used as ordinate only (in pair with x).

            quote (``bool``, *optional*):
                Useful for normal buttons only, where pressing it will result in a new message sent.
                If ``True``, the message will be sent as a reply to this message.

            timeout (``int``, *optional*):
                Timeout in seconds.

            request_write_access (``bool``, *optional*):
                Only used in case of :obj:`~pyrogram.types.LoginUrl` button.
                True, if the bot can send messages to the user.
                Defaults to ``True``.

            password (``str``, *optional*):
                When clicking certain buttons (such as BotFather's confirmation button to transfer ownership), if your account has 2FA enabled, you need to provide your account's password.
                The 2-step verification password for the current user. Only applicable, if the :obj:`~pyrogram.types.InlineKeyboardButton` contains ``requires_password``.

        Returns:
            -   The result of :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.request_callback_answer` in case of inline callback button clicks.
            -   The result of :meth:`~Message.reply()` in case of normal button clicks.
            -   A string in case the inline button is a URL, a *switch_inline_query* or a
                *switch_inline_query_current_chat* button.
            -   A string URL with the user details, in case of a WebApp button.
            -   A :obj:`~pyrogram.types.Chat` object in case of a ``KeyboardButtonUserProfile`` button.

        Raises:
            RPCError: In case of a Telegram RPC error.
            ValueError: In case the provided index or position is out of range or the button label was not found.

                object or a Client instance in order to edit the message with the updated progress status.

                The amount of bytes transmitted so far.

            total (``int``):
