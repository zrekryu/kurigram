class ErrorHandler:
    """The Error handler class. Used to handle unexpected errors.

    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`.

    For a more convenient way to register this handler, see the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_error` decorator.

    Note: This class does not subclasses :class:`~pyrogram.handlers.handler.Handler`.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            A function that will be called whenever an unexpected error is raised.
            It takes the following positional arguments: *(exception, handler, client, *args)*.

        exceptions (``Exception`` | ``Sequence[Exception]``, *optional*):
            An exception type or a sequence of exception types that this handler should handle.
            If None, the handler will catch any exception that is a subclass of ``Exception``.
            Defaults to ``None``.

    Other parameters passed to the callback:
        exception (``Exception``):
            The Exception instance that was raised.

        handler (:obj:`~pyrogram.handlers.handler.Handler`):
            The Handler instance from which the exception was raised.

        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client instance, useful when calling other API methods inside the error handler.

        *args (``tuple[Any, ...]``):
            The original arguments passed to the handler.
