class RawUpdateHandler(Handler):
    """The Raw Update handler class. Used to handle raw updates. It is intended to be used with
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_raw_update` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            A function that will be called when a new update is received from the server. It takes
            *(client, update, users, chats)* as positional arguments (look at the section below for
            a detailed description).

        filters (:obj:`Filters`):
            Pass one or more filters to allow only a subset of updates to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other Parameters:
        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the update handler.

        context: The received raw update context.

    .. note::

        The following Empty or Forbidden types may exist inside the *users* and *chats* dictionaries.
        They mean you have been blocked by the user or banned from the group/channel.

        - :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.types.UserEmpty`
        - :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.types.ChatEmpty`
        - :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.types.ChatForbidden`
        - :obj:`~pyrogram.raw.types.ChannelForbidden`
